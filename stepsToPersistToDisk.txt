List of known steps required to write everything to disk and load up a fully-trained ppc instance at some future point:

data-formatter: min-max-scalers (one per column)
data-formatter: imputing missing values
  what counts as a missing value
  what is it replaced by?
  this is just some code I picked off the internet, so we'll have to save and load this module by hand
    it shouldn't be hard though- just save one overall list of what is considered a missing value
    save an array, with one value for each column, that is the replacement value for that column.
data-formatter:
    minimum date in date column
