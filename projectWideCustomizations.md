# Advanced Customizations

There are many parameters throughout this project that you may want to chage. 
You are, in fact, highly encouraged to customize this for your own particular use! 
The project is designed to be modular and well-documented enough that it should be pretty easy to understand where to go to find different values you might want to change. 

As a rough guide, here are some of those values you might cusotmize:
imputed values:
  what is considered a missing value in your dataset?
  what should missing values be replaced by? (mean, median, most common value for that column, etc.)
If you are using a neural network that takes values from -1 to 1, we are currently assuming values from 0 to 1
