BeforEach: copy the exact classifier name to your clipboard so we can be consistent. 

1. classifierList.js- just add the name, in both dev and non-dev spots
2. paramaterMakers/classifierName: create the parameters, make available through a function called makeParams that returns a dict that can be passed directly into the classifier. 
3. paramMakers.py: add the new file as a module to be imported and as a part of the returned dict. make sure to add a comma in between properties :)
4. makeClassifiers.py: add the instantiated classifier here with the parameters it should have. make sure to add a comma in between properties :)
5. paramMakers folder: if this is just a new split of the same algorith (rf with gini, and rf with entropy), go back to paramMakers/classifierName and make sure the new one is mutually exclusive with the old one
6. extendedTrainingList.py: state whether there is an extended training version of this classifier available. This step is somewhat redundent, but makes it clear that a classifier not being in makeBigClassifiers.py is intentional
7. makeBigClassifiers.py: add in a 'larger' version of the classifier- typically by bumping up n_estimators dramatically
